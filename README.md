# Wine Quality Analysis Project

This repository contains a Python project for analyzing the quality of red wine based on various chemical properties using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

Wine quality analysis is an important task for winemakers and wine enthusiasts to understand the characteristics of wine and make informed decisions. This project aims to develop a predictive model to analyze the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties.

## Features

- Preprocesses the wine quality dataset and prepares it for analysis.
- Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict wine quality based on chemical properties.
- Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy score and classification report.
- Provides insights into the factors influencing wine quality.

## Setup

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
          git clone https://github.com/Divya-Chhetri/Major_Project_Wine-Quality-Analysis.git


2. Install the required dependencies:
          pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Download the wine quality dataset (e.g., 'winequality-red.csv') and place it in the project directory.

4. Run the main script:
           python wine_quality_analysis.py


## Usage

- Modify the dataset filename in the script if using a different dataset.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters for analysis.
- Explore additional preprocessing steps and feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.

## Results

After running the script, you will see the accuracy score and a classification report providing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class in the wine quality dataset.
